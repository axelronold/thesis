# thesis
This repo contains the source code which layed the foundation for the analysis in my master thesis in Industrial Mathematics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The main focus of the paper is to take a deepdive into the notion of uncertain multi-objective optimization and also introduce a new method that has never been used on these types of problems, the weighted constraint method, and see how it performs. The code generates problems in form of several feasible sets and then see how the method performs in competition with another already used method on such problems, the weighted sum method. The performance is measured in how many solutions both methods find when compared to each other and also the computation time used per method.
